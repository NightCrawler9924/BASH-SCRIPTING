**Bash Scripting Resources**

Overview
    This repository contains my Bash scripting notes along with example scripts Iâ€™ve written to practice and demonstrate Bash concepts. Itâ€™s a living document, I will continue updating and expanding these             resources over time.

Contents
    BASH.docx â€” Detailed Bash scripting notes covering basics, variables, conditionals, loops, and more.
    
    run_all.sh â€” Simple script that shows the current date and lists the contents of a user-specified directory.
    
    check_positive_negative.sh â€” Script to demonstrate conditionals by checking if a number is positive or negative.
    
    file_manager.sh â€” Interactive menu-driven script for managing files within a specified directory. Supports viewing, creating, appending, deleting, and moving files with input validation.

How to Use
    Running Scripts
    Make sure the script files have executable permissions:
    chmod +x run_all.sh check_positive_negative.sh file_manager.sh


Run a script by typing:
    ./run_all.sh
    ./check_positive_negative.sh <number>
    ./file_manager.sh

Example:
    ./check_positive_negative.sh 15
    About the Scripts
    run_all.sh
    
    Displays todayâ€™s date.
    
    Prompts the user to enter a directory path.

    Prompts for a directory and validates its existence.
    
    Shows an interactive menu to:
    
    View files in the directory
    
    View a specific fileâ€™s contents
    
    Create new files

    Move files
    
    Includes basic error handling for invalid input and file existence.


Notes
These resources cover fundamental Bash commands, scripting syntax, variables, input/output handling, conditionals, loops, and good scripting practices. The notes and scripts aim to guide beginners towards intermediate Bash scripting proficiency.
