# Bash Scripting Resources  

---

## Overview

This repository contains my Bash scripting notes along with example scripts Iâ€™ve written to practice and demonstrate Bash concepts. **Itâ€™s a living document, I will continue updating and expanding these resources over time.**

---

## Contents

- `notes.md` â€” Detailed Bash scripting notes covering basics, variables, conditionals, loops, and more.  
- `run_all.sh` â€” Simple script that shows the current date and lists the contents of a user-specified directory.  
- `check_positive_negative.sh` â€” Script to demonstrate conditionals by checking if a number is positive or negative.

---

## How to Use

### Running Scripts

Make sure the script files have executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x run_all.sh check_positive_negative.sh
Run a script by typing:

  ./run_all.sh
  ./check_positive_negative.sh <number>

For example:

  ./check_positive_negative.sh 15

About the Scripts
  run_all.sh
  Displays todayâ€™s date.

Prompts the user to enter a directory path.

Lists the contents of the specified directory.

  check_positive_negative.sh
  Accepts a number as a command-line argument.

  Prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero using Bash conditionals.

Notes
  These cover fundamental commands, scripting syntax, variables, input/output handling, conditionals, loops, and good scripting practices. The notes are designed to help beginners move towards intermediate Bash scripting skills.
